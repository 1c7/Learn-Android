        Customize the Animation with PageTransformer
        To display a different animation from the default screen slide animation,
        implement the ViewPager.PageTransformer interface and supply it to the view pager.
        The interface exposes a single method, transformPage(). At each point in the screen\'s transition,
        this method is called once for each visible page (generally there\'s only one visible page) \
        and for adjacent pages just off the screen. For example, if page three is visible and the user
        drags towards page four, transformPage() is called for pages two, three, and four at each step
        of the gesture.
        In your implementation of transformPage(), you can then create custom slide animations by
        determining which pages need to be transformed based on the position of the page on the screen,
        which is obtained from the position parameter of the transformPage() method.
